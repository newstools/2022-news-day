CRANBORNE Bullets coach Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera says fatigue from weekly travels was responsible for his team’s poor run. The army side seems to have forgotten how to win, registering their last full points haul on match day 12 when they beat Caps United 2-0 away at the National Sports Stadium. They are currently on a three-game losing run. Cranborne Bullets are based in Harare, but have to travel to Mutare for their home matches at Sakubva Stadium. There is a shortage of stadia in Harare where Dynamos, Caps United, Herentals and Harare Citry all share the National Sports Stadium. That has forced Cranborne Bullets and Black Rhinos to seek accommodation elsewhere and both teams utilise Sakubva. “We are being affected by fatigue, we are always on the road and it is really affecting our performance we are just hoping our issues of grounds will be sorted soon,” Saruchera told NewsDay Sports yesterday. It is not the first time this season Saruchera’s side have lost thrice on the road  as they lost to Harare City, Black Rhinos and Ngezi Platinum on match day five, six and seven respectively. Saruchera is hoping that his side will improve despite the difficult circumstances. “We will bounce back soon I have so much faith and belief in the quality we have but as a team we must also grind out results even if it appears to be difficult to do so,” Saruchera said. Cranborne Bullets host high flying FC Platinum at Sakubva on Saturday.
