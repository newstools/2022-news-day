A ZIMBABWE Red Cross Society employee has been arraigned before a Harare magistrate over fraud allegations after issuing nurse aide certificates to untrained individuals in return for US$50. Debra Tembedza (40), who is employed by Red Cross as a registry clerk, on Friday appeared before magistrate Yeukai Dzuda charged with fraud. Tembedza is jointly charged with Libangani Phillip Langa (45), who is not employed. They were remanded in custody to today for bail ruling. It is alleged that Tembedza’s duties included printing of students certificates, among others. Working in cahoots, Tembedza and Langa scouted for people looking to be certified and charged US$50 per person. Jese Chigaveni, the ZRCS security and liaison officer, acting on a tip-off, alerted the police who arrested the pair on January 20. Tembedza was found in possession of five certificates. Checks on the Red Cross Society examination attendance register revealed that the people who were issued with the certificates never took part in the training programmes.
