THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) yesterday advised fuel operators to continue using the December 2021 fuel prices as it monitors developments on the international market and awaits finalisation of consultations currently taking place with the government. According to Statutory Instrument 270 of 2019 Petroleum Products Pricing Regulations, Zera is supposed to review fuel prices by the 5th of each month. In a statement, Zera said: “However, due to consultations that are taking place at government level, as we monitor developments on the international oil markets, Zera will issue a statement on the January 2022 fuel prices after the statutory set dates. “Fuel operators are, therefore, urged to continue trading as per the December 2021 fuel prices, while consultations are being finalised. The January 2022 fuel prices will be announced in due course.” Recently, Zera extended the expiry date of fuel procurement (import) licences to January 15, to ensure that there is no fuel supply
disruption. Zera increased the price of petrol last month to US$1,42 from US$1,40 per litre in November, while diesel price remained stagnant at US$1,38 per litre.
