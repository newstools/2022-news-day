A HARARE man has been arraigned before the courts on allegations of defrauding his victim of US$4 530 in a botched vehicle deal. The suspect, Larry Makahamadze (34), on Friday appeared before magistrate Yeukai Dzuda, who granted him $10 000 bail. The case was remanded to February 2 for routine remand. The State alleges that sometime in March 2019, Makahamadze misrepresented to Enias Tanyongana that he was selling a Mercedes-Benz C180 for
US$4 530. Makahamadze alleged that he was selling the motor vehicle to raise capital for his business of supplying laptops. It was, however, later discovered that the vehicle was non-existent after Tanyongana had already paid for it. Only US$1 230 was recovered. Prosecutor Lynette Gwarisa represented the State.
