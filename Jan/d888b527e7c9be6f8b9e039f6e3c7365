BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE A POLICE man based in Kuwadzana has been arraigned before the courts for stealing US$90 from a dead person. Donald Chinenyanga (33) on Friday appeared before Harare magistrate Sharon Rakafa on theft charges after he allegedly stole US$90 from a man who had been murdered. Chinenyanga was released on $10 000 bail. On January 7 this year in the evening, Chinenyanga, in the company of two police constables, went to a murder scene at a house in Kuwadzana 5. Among the personal effects on the deceased was a wallet with foreign currency. Chinenyanga failed to record the money at the police station, leading to his arrest after the other officers reported the matter.
