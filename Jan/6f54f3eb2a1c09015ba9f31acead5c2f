BY SHARON SIBINDI CO-FOUNDER of globetrotting imbube group — Black Umfolosi, Tomeki Dube has said they will take time to reflect on the past to see what they did right and what went wrong as they celebrate 40 years of presence in the showbiz industry this March. The five-member Bulawayo-based Black Umfolosi was founded in March 1982 and has so far released 15 albums with more than five awards under its belt. It is famed for its hit song — Unity which was released in 1990. Dube told NewsDay Life & Style that 2022 was a year of writing Black Umfolosi’s biography, producing a video documentary and strengthening their junior policy. “Black Umfolosi turns 40 on March 15. This year, we will reflect on the past to see what we did well, what went wrong and move on wisely with much strength,” he said. Dube said a lot of activities were lined up for this year as part of celebrating their 40th anniversary including opening doors to collaborations with other artistes. “2022 is the year for collaborative works with those who respect and are interested in our works. This year, we are reaching out to schools mainly within Bulawayo to train and share experiences with the children,” he said. “This year we are opening our doors for collaborative work from across Zimbabwe to celebrate our entire journey with friends in the arts industry including our music followers.” Dube added: “It is also a year to revisit the Enkundleni Centre Programmes. Consultations and engaging with the young focused team on all developmental endeavours of Black Umfolosi are in progress.” “COVID-19 challenges may limit us here and there, but our programme roll-out is set. Besides the 40th anniversary celebrations, depending on the containment of the COVID-19, we should
resume our tours getting ready to travel to the United Kingdom and Canada with the possibility of going to the United States of America as well.”
