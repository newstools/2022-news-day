ZIMBABWEAN fashion designer and founder of Ganu Designs, Nkanyezi Malunga says she is looking at exploring international markets inspired by the success of her recent hybrid fashion exhibition themed Umtshado Ka Mbulumakhasane held in Bulawayo. Malunga said Umtshado Ka Mbulumakhasane fashion exhibition was meant to integrate innovations of women in the rural areas with those from an urban environment. “This year, we are looking at exploring more indigenous knowledge systems and taking them to the world. “We believe it’s high time Zimbabwe’s fashion industry took its fair portion in the international economy,” she said. “We are also looking at exploring international markets this year seeing how the exhibition catapulted not only the Ganu brand, but also brand Zimbabwe.” Malunga said although 2021 was a challenging year, it had opened many avenues for her. “Last year, I found myself exploring avenues I had been contemplating. The Vikela iCovid project and Umtshado Ka Mbulumakhasane exhibition were the restart of a creative journey after the lockdown,” she said. “I also learnt the importance of having the proper team and right energies to help see through your vision. This year, 2022 will see a bespoke ready to wear collection and Umtshado Ka Mbulumakhasane.” She added: “Umtshado Ka Mbulumakhasane exhibition is there again this year. “We will yet again look at tapping into our rural and urban talent and beauty to celebrate each other as women and as Africans.” “We will exhibit a bespoke and ready to wear collection inspired by my childhood adventures. We will also continue with the training of women in the rural communities.” Follow Sharon Sibindi on Twitter @SibindiSharon
