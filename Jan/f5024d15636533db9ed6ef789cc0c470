Kevin Mapasure Caps United have agreed terms with striker Rodwell Chinyengetere who has left FC Platinum after failing to agree a new deal with the Zvishavane based side. Chinyengetere is set to become the Green Machine’s first signing in this window, but the club is battling to convince some of its stars to stay due to financial issues. A source told NewsDay Sport that Chinyegetere has agreed in principle to join Caps United, but is waiting for the club to meet part of the deal before a contract can be signed. He is one of seven senior players that have left FC Platinum after their contracts expired at the end of last year. Kelvin Madzongwe, Rahman Kutsanzira, Petros Mhari, Donald Dzvinyai, Ralph Kawondera and Stanley Ngala have all left the platinum miners. Kawondera has since signed for Dynamos. The signing of Chinyengetere is set to lift the mood at Caps, who have lost players among them Brendon Mpofu and Carlos Mavhurume. The threat of losing more stars still looms large as the club battles to convince players, who are owed two months salaries, to commit to new deals. Chinyengetere would come in handy for Caps United who have struggled for goals since Ishamel Wadi left for South Africa last year.
