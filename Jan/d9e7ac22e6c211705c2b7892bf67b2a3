LOCAL actor Robert Chiyama has lashed out at film directors and producers, whom he accused of manipulating artistes to enrich themselves. Chiyama, who does short skits, drama, musical videos and voice overs for commercials on radio and television, told NewsDay Life & Style that most artistes, particularly those in the film industry, were struggling to make ends meet as a result of exploitation by those who are supposed to support them. He stressed that financial problems were stiffing the growth of most actors in the country and the film industry in general. “There are producers, who use actors and fail to pay them after they have executed their duties,” he said. Chiyama made his acting debut when he featured in the drama titled Zvinoitika Murudo and internationally he was part of the film The Hero, where he played the role of war veterans leader. “I have featured in other theatre productions which were and some are still being broadcast on ZTV. These include Mariyakanaka, whereby I am currently acting as Madzibaba Chinara, Kuzviparira, a Zimtale production where I featured as Tobias,” said Chiyama. “I have also done voice overs for the drama Purazi Rasinyoro as Collen and on the drama Area 7 as the police officer.” Chiyama also featured in films and dramas such as Diaspora, Cook off, Inbox, Murindagomo, Kanukai, Tozeza Baba and Chisara. He said despite having an innate acting talent, he honed his skills at the Robert Mushengu School of Acting.
