Manicaland Police spokesman assistant inspector Wiseman Chinyoka today confirmed the arrest of two copper cables thieves in Mutare.  He said two others are still at large. Chinyoka said on January 4, police at Mutare Central Police Station received a tip-off that there were four people digging a trench in Fairbridge Park near the Wise Owl hotel in Mutare. He said police reacted swiftly to the tip off. “After the arrival of police, the four cable thieves fled in different directions into the dense forest.  However police managed to arrest two suspects, Godfrey Mutsingo and Peter Manase.  They were caught with a 40 metre copper cable.  The two other suspects are still at large,” Chinyoka said.
