A LOSING candidate in the Zanu PF primary elections for the Dangamvura/Chikanga constituency reportedly assaulted a fellow member after losing his bid to represent the party in the March 26 by-elections. Clyde Jani reportedly assaulted Malcom Masarira, ward 14 chairperson, on Sunday morning accusing him of being behind his defeat in the internal party polls held last Friday. Jani was defeated by central committee member Esau Mupfumi. The matter was reported at Mutare Central Police Station under RRB number 4958593. Masarira was left with a swollen face after the alleged beating by Jani, meted out with the assistance of his supporters at around 2am yesterday morning. “I was being tracked by the people that assaulted me and at around 2am on Sunday. Clyde Jani and a group of about 10 people approached me and started assaulting me,” Masarira said. “They threatened to kill me for supporting Mupfumi during the primary elections. They accused me of causing Jani’s defeat. “I was beaten up with fists, and they forcibly took me to Mutare DCC [district co-ordinating committee] chairperson Binali Yard just to beat me up. They also threatened to take me to Mupfumi’s house, where they said they would beat me up while he watched. However, Yard then negotiated for my release.” Masarira said Jani told him that he spent US$87 000 during the campaign. Yesterday, Masarira went to Mutare General Hospital, to seek treatment for the injuries he sustained during the assault. Jani told NewsDay that Masarira was beaten up by a Zanu PF supporter called Heaven Chihono. “It’s a lie. I was not at the scene on the day. He was assaulted by Heaven Chihono,” Jani said. Efforts to get a comment from Yard yesterday were unsuccessful.
