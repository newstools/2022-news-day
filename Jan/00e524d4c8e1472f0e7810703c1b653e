A Zimbabwean activist called on his followers to carry out terrorist attacks to overthrow his country’s regime in a series of speeches, a court heard. William Chinyanga, 51, is accused of encouraging bombings in the south-east African country in four speeches to 7,000 followers on social media over two days in December 2019. It is claimed the supply teacher, who lives in north London, told Facebook followers to ‘open gunfire on a gathering of people’ and use ‘gorilla warfare’. Chinyanga is understood to be a campaigner for MDC-alliance, a multi-party political bloc that opposes Emmerson Mnangagwa’s ruling Zanu-PF government in Zimbabwe. The Old Bailey was told he has been charged with four counts of encouraging terrorism, which he denies. Prosecutor Sean Larkin QC said Chinyanga, who was born in Zimbabwe, sought asylum in 2009 and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK ‘There is no dispute he is an opponent of the Zimbabwean government,’ he continued. ‘He had a Facebook account and over a two-day period, the 1st and 2nd December 2019 he livestreamed four speeches to his Facebook followers, over 7,000 followers. ‘He speaks in a mixture of English and Shona and he speaks against the Zimbabwean government. – dailymail
