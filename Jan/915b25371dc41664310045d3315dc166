BlackBerry devices using the company’s original software and services will no longer work from 4 January 2022. The company announced that devices operating on BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry 7.1 software will not be able to reliably function on carrier networks or on Wi-Fi. This means that the phones will no longer be able to make phone calls, use data, send text messages or even make emergency calls. BlackBerry was a dominant player at the start of the smartphone era during the 2000s. However, following the prominent rise of the iPhone and Google Android gadgets, its devices fell out of favour with consumers. In 2013, the company tried to make a comeback when it introduced a touchscreen only phone – shying away from its traditional design of a physical keyboard. However, due to poor sales, it was forced to consider a deal. In 2016, BlackBerry announced that it would no longer manufacture its devices and in 2020 it shut down its legacy services attached to the devices. Since then, the company has shifted to offering security software to businesses and governments. “BlackBerry retains personal information as long as necessary for the fulfilment of BlackBerry’s identified purposes or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable laws. When personal information is no longer necessary or relevant, BlackBerry will delete, destroy, erase, or anonymise your data,” the company said in their statement.-The citizen.
