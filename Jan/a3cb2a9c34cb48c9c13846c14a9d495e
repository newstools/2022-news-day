The ETF is meant to seek capital appreciation on ZSE by way of purchasing units on the security which will invest primarily in banks, and real estate-related firms, insurance and reinsurance companies, industrial and non-industrial companies and financial holding companies. According to the ETF’s prospectus, 80% of the fund’s investable asset base will go to financial services and real estate companies while 20% may be invested in industrial and non-industrial companies. The manager of the fund, TN Asset Management, primarily allocates the fund’s portfolio investments using a proprietary model developed by Morgan & Co which focuses on firms that are fundamentally sound and well-managed. The model will also focus on firms that are reasonably expected to deliver future earnings per share growth in excess of Zimbabwe’s consumer price inflation. At the time of listing, ETF was expected to consist of Old Mutual Zimbabwe Limited, NMBZ Bank Limited, First Mutual Holdings Limited, First Capital Bank Limited, and Zimra Holdings Limited.
