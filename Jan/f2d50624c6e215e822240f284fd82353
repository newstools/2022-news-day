The Zimbabwe Football Association board has suspended the Premier Soccer League chief executive officer, Kenny Ndebele and all the congress members who signed a petition calling for an Emergency General Meeting, which was supposed to be held on Saturday. Zifa’s move is a desperate attempt at making sure that the meeting, which they have to hold by April 3 does not go ahead. Last week Fifa ruled that the Zifa executive committee should organise the meeting by April 3 failure to which the Congress can hold the meeting.  Zifa president Felton Kamambo and Philemon Machana are set to lose their posts at that meeting as they are accused of abusing covid 19 relief funds from Fifa and Caf as well as sweeping under the carpet match fixing and sexual abuse allegations.
