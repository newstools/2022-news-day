Warriors captain Knowledge Musona said he is considering retiring from international football following Zimbabwe’s exit from the Africa Cup of Nations. Musona was quoted by BBC saying that he will make an announcement when the time is right. He hinted that he may not add to his 51 caps. He scored Zimbabwe’s opening goal in their 2-1  win over Guinea in their last Group B match. “I am still thinking about it,” he said. “When the time comes I will announce it.” Once he does eventually hang up his boots, Musona is considering taking a role in the development of Zimbabwean football himself. “Maybe, because I really love my country and I will do anything to help my country achieve being one of the best teams,” he said. “We have the talent but sometimes we don’t have the resources. When the time comes I will be open to help my country to develop this sport.” Coach Norman Mapeza believes Musona has already made a lasting impact in the south-east African country. “He has contributed massively to football,” he said. “You don’t have to doubt his contribution to Zimbabwean football – to me he is one of the legends of Zimbabwean football.”
