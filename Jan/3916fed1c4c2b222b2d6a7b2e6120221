MANCHESTER United ace Mason Greenwood has been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault. Police confirmed the 20-year-old striker remains in custody over the allegations which came to light in a series of graphic Instagram posts this morning. His Premier League club also announced he has been suspended indefinitely. They confirmed the forward will not return to training or play matches “until further notice” as it “does not condone violence of any kind”. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: “Police were made aware earlier today (Sunday 30 January) of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. “An investigation was launched and following enquiries we can confirm a man in his 20s has since been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault. “He remains in custody for questioning. Enquiries are ongoing.” -The Sun
