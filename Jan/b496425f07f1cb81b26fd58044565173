UP-AND-COMING gospel artiste Kudakwashe Madzima (22) believes his music will go a long way in uplifting and comforting those struggling with life. Madzima told NewsDay Life & Style that his song titled Aripo Jeso was influenced by women who struggle in life, but don’t give up. Featuring Shamiso Madzima, Aripo Jeso was produced by Ngonidzaishe Madzima under a production company called Mega Punch Records. Madzima explains the importance of sticking to God’s word and trusting in him. “In trying times that we are, I realised that women are suffering the most and this track is dedicated to them as it urges them to stick to prayer as their fortress,” said Madzima. “By giving examples of Sarah from the Bible l wanted to encourage them that there is nothing impossible here on earth as long as we trust in God.” “Gospel music is a style of Christian music that has both inspired and drawn me into ministering the word of God at such a young age and has deeply influenced me in my whole life,” he said. Madzima said he was motivated by other gospel artistes to join the genre. “I loved gospel music particularly because whenever I listen to other artistes sing there are a number of lessons deduced from those songs, hence I favoured gospel,” he said. Although Aripo Jeso is a dedication to women, it also carries a message of inspiration to everyone that all trust should be given to God who handles situations without failure. Madzima also advised the youths that they should embrace gospel music as a way of ministering the word. He urged other up-and-coming gospel musicians to solder on, preaching the word through music.
