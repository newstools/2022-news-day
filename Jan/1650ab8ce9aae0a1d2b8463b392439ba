The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) has suspended the appointment Moris Mpofu as acting commissioner-general hardly two days after his appointment. This follows public outrage after it emerged that Mpofu was once fired from the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) on allegations of corruption and criminal abuse of office. Mpofu was set to take over from Rameck Masaire who was due to retire on February 1, 2022. However, Masaire will continue to serve as acting commissioner-general. “The ZIMRA board wishes to inform members of staff that the assumption of duty of Moris Mpofu as acting commissioner general of the authority has been suspended. Accordingly, Rameck Masaire will continue to serve as acting commissioner-general of the authority,” Zimra said in a statement.  In May 2019, ZCDC board of directors fired seven senior executives, including Mpofu, who was chief executive officer, following reports of corruption and abuse of office. Mpofu was in the same year arraigned before the courts on criminal abuse of office charges after he allegedly recommended the selling of diamonds to a ‘blacklisted’ buyer.  Mpofu was later cleared of the charges.
