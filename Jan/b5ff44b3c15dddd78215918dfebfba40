RISING songstress Tamia Chataika has dropped her new Amapiano track titled Giribheti on YouTube. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style Chataika said the song was motivated by failing relationships and deceptions from men. “I wrote the song Giribheti at a time where people are referring to love as a ‘pandemic’. The negativity towards relationships inspired me to pen the song complimented by my relationship experience,” she said. “The inspiration behind the title of the song is based on the streets definition of a”player “,someone who enjoys being in a series of relationships. The song’s lyrics talk about a lady who is fed up because of lies and empty promises she keeps getting from a guy in their relationship.” Some of the songs’s lyrics…goes like are Moyo wangu waneta nemanyepo ako Giribheti (my heart is fade up of your lies Gilbert). Chataika who ventured into music professionally in 2021said she draws her inspiration from the late Chiwoniso Maraire, Tammy Moyo and multi-award-winning singer Jah Prayzah. “Professionally I started music last year in April when I released my debut single Ndoshingirira. Before that, I participated in the school choir as the lead vocalist and later joined a Chitungwiza community choral group, Glorious Melodies Choir,” she said. “I chose music over other arts activities because I feel like I can express myself more when I am singing. It feels different when I am doing music. I have never tried doing anything except music, so music is where my heart belongs.” Chataika said the song’s video will be dropped in the first week of February.
