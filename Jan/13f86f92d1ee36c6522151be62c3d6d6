GOVERNMENT has scrapped the US$20 electronic passport (e-passport) application fee following public outcry over the controversial decision to give CBZ bank monopoly to process the fee. Last year, Statutory Instrument (SI) 273 of 2021 was gazetted introducing new e-passport. Passport processing fee was pegged at US$100, with an extra application fee of US$20 that was to be paid through CBZ bank only. Home Affairs minister Kazembe Kazembe gazetted SI 3 of 2022, rescinding the decision to charge US$20 as application fee. However, the gazetted fees for both ordinary and emergency passport remained the same under the new SI. “It is hereby notified that the Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural heritage, has in terms of Section 22 of the Citizenship of Zimbabwe Act [Chapter 4:01], made the following regulations: These regulations may be cited as the Citizenship (Passport Fees) Regulations, 2022. The fees payable for obtaining one’s passport shall be (a) passport issued on non-emergency US$100 (b) emergency passport US$ 200.”
