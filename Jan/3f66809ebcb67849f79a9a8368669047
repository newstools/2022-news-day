TELEVISION personality Vimbai Rachael Nyamudeza says she has embarked on a charity initiative under the theme Help Me, Help Them as part of her 23rd birthday celebrations set for January 20 in Harare. Nyamudeza, who is also a videographer and photographer, told NewsDay Life & Style that her desire was to lend a helping hand to the disadvantaged. “I love sharing the little I have as nothing gives me peace and joy than seeing others smile. “In fact, I am naturally a giver,” she said. “For the campaign, I have so far managed to buy a few groceries and I am kindly appealing for more help from well-wishers who would want to be part of this initiative to also give a hand in the form of cash or kind.” Nyamudeza said she would donate the proceeds to less-privileged people in Epworth. “What have I done that people can remember me for? This is the question that motivates and pushes me to do good and best for others. I am that person who finds joy, happiness and peace in giving,” she said. “Those who wish to fund or help the campaign in any way possible can deposit the money in my FBC account, (FBC 6017 0422 0008 1339) Nelson Mandela Branch or via EcoCash on 0784 707 083.” Apart from being a presenter for a religious programme on ABJ TV titled For Young People being broadcast on DStv, the multi-talented Nyamudeza said she was on a mission to establish a foundation called Vimbai Says that helps the less-privileged, disabled and elderly.
