BY TERRY MADYAUTA BARELY a month after the departure of Silas Songani, Ralph Kawondera and Stanley Ngala, FC Platinum looks set to lose another senior player as defender Donald Dzvinyai has been linked with a move to Harare City. The former Triangle centreback, who joined the Zvishavane side in 2020 during Heindrikus Pieter de Jongh’s tenure, was initially said to have agreed to stay at the club for one more season. However, it has now emerged that talks for a contract extension broke down. Dzvinyai’s agent then allegedly took his client to Harare City and talks are said to be at an advanced stage. A deal could be concluded by end of this week, a source claimed yesterday. It is not clear what has triggered a player exodus at FC Platinum, which has seen a number of senior players leaving the club. Songani has returned to Europe after signing for a club in Iceland, while Kawondera has joined Dynamos. Ngala was unveiled by Highlanders yesterday, while reports suggest that Kelvin Madzongwe could also be heading out. Bulawayo Chiefs have been reported as his next destination. The pair of Rahman Kutsanzira and Denzel Khumalo are also on their way out and are expected to rejoin Highlanders before the transfer window closes. The departures would worry some FC Platinum supporters, but it could be a blessing in disguise to some young players in the team. This could be a window of opportunity for some of the juniors who were recently recruited by coach Norman Mapeza to prove their worth in the team’s title defence. These include the likes of Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya, Oscar Bhebhe, Hagaizo Magaya along with Kelvin Mangiza and Panashe Matimbanyoka, who are already regulars in the team.
