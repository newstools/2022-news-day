BY WINSTONE ANTONIO FRANCE-BASED Zimbabwean writer and social justice activist, Abel Mavura said his latest book titled Never A Last episode sought to demystify some deep-rooted cultural beliefs and norms that hinder people from achieving their dreams. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, the Mutoko-bred Mavura described the book as an enticing and mouth-watering fictional story. “I am excited to be releasing this third book which I have been working on for almost three years. I wanted to launch it in 2021, but owing to COVID-19 I was behind in almost everything and the mission failed,” he said. “The book seeks to demystify some deep-rooted cultural beliefs, myths and norms which inhibit progress in society and hinder one from pursuing their talents, particularly looking at education.” Mavura said the book’s storyline was centred on a boy called Taku, who grew up under the impression that he was working hard at school to make his parents happy. In an effort to achieve this, things fell apart. Mavura, who is also a development practitioner and journalist, started his writing career a decade ago writing and directing plays for social change at his Marvel Act Youth Organisation (MAYO). He launched his debut motivational book in 2017 titled The Art of Realising Your Dream, which he said was meant to inspire young people to realise their dreams despite the challenges they face. Mavura was recently honoured with an award for civic leadership by Gumiguru for the work he has been doing through MAYO in Mutoko and surrounding districts. He was last year selected as one of the exhibiting authors from southern Africa at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Africa week Authors Lounge in France.
