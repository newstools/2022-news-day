By Paul Vutete The former Zimbabwean rugby player Mordecai ‘Bhuru’ Mwerenga died in a car accident in the UK at the weekend. Mwerenga’s friend Edmond Mutetwa confirmed news of Mwerenga’s death today. “When we talk about rugby legends Mordecai Mwerenga is one of them to me he was more than just a homeboy but was my role model and inspiration. I remember as I grew up I used to follow him during morning jogs trying to do what he does.” “Mwerenga’s death is actually a loss to me as he was one of my role models, if I am to mention sports heroes in Zimbabwe he is up there,” said Mutetwa. Despite having ventured in various sporting fields such as soccer, basketball and hockey it is rugby however that took him to greater heights even landing him as far as UK. “He ventured into sport when he was at David Livingstone primary school before he became the basketball and rugby player he also made into hockey district team.” He played for clubs such as Pioneer Blazers but enhanced his profile at Old Hararians where he played alongside former Sables skipper Costa Dinha.
