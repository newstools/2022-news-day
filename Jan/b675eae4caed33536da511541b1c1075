The suspension was with immediate effect pending investigations into the various allegations levelled against her. Investigations are being conducted by a team led by the party’s Arbiter General. The suspension is in line with the party’s constitution and is a result of certain issues that arose. Once the said issues are investigated and fully resolved, the party will communicate such.”  Khupe recently filed a court application at the High Court seeking an order to stop MDC -T leader Douglas Mwonzora from recalling her from Parliament. The court is yet to make a ruling on the matter.
