ONLINE designer firm Xe Fresh has rolled out an amateur graphic designers competition which seeks to identify, promote and develop up-and-coming creatives in Zimbabwe. Founder of Xe Fresh, Albert Mathema told NewsDay Life & Style that the competition roared to life on January 1 under the theme Graphic Design + Music and ends on April 3. “The competition’s registration is free and it aims to uplift all Zimbabwean graphic designers regardless of their age. It is open to all amateur creatives residing in Zimbabwe,” he said. “Contestants can participate as individuals or a duo. Contestants will be tasked to visualise a song as a graphic design piece.” Mathema said several people had registered for the competition so far. “The contestants select a song from a list of artistes provided and proceed to create an A3 design, a poster for each of the three artistes that interprets the songs in their creative way,” he said. He said the first prize would include a HUION HS610 10×6,25inch graphic design tablet and a participation certificate, adding that the second and third prizes would be announced. Xe Fresh was founded by Project Kamili Creatives Agency in 2021.
