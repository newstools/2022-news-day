BY NKOSENTSHA KHUMALO POPULAR Bulawayo comedian Mdawini “Uncle Zex” Sibanda, who was recently bashed on a Zupco bus after his dry joke about lodgers did not go down well with some of the passengers, will be in a debut stage show tomorrow at Bulawayo Theatre. The show will be a new territory for Uncle Zex, who normally throws jokes in public while recording them before circulating the audios or videos on social media platforms. He will be supported by two other comedians Dalubuhle “Da lu da Comedian” Mdlongwa and Frank Chirisa. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style, Uncle Zex, who released Zimbabwe’s first comedy album titled Classy But not Kasi last year, urged comedy fans to come in their numbers for rib-cracking jokes. “I have been freely doing jokes all along to entertain fans, but the Friday show will be the first ever where the audience is set to pay an entry fee of US$3,” he said. “I am also working on new jokes and I promise my audience a great show at the theatre in the presence of other comics who will be featured in the show.” Da lu da Comedian said they were working hard to make the show a high-profile event. “I am excited to work with Uncle Zex since this will be the first time people will, indeed, be given value for their money and their attendance,” he said. Said Chirisa: “Bulawayo Theatre now feels like home to me and I am excited to work with Uncle Zex who is one of the funniest people we have in the city and Da lu da Comedian who is one of my close friends as we grew up together and I have shared the stage with him several times.” One of the event organisers from Entertainments Box Events, Thembelihle Ncube said they were looking forward to a great show.
