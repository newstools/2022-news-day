AFTER a two-year sabbatical induced by COVID-19 travel restrictions, Bulawayo-based all-female a capella group Nobuntu has embarked on a three-month tour of the United States of America. The award-winning group left the country last week and will stage 23 shows at different venues. Nobuntu staged its first show on Monday at the University of Georgia, Athens, with its last show scheduled for March 25 at the Door Community Auditorium. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style, one of  the members Heather Dube said they were geared to stage memorable shows. “It feels so surreal seeing how we have not been on an international stage for the past two years. We promise nothing short of a stage-starved Nobuntu that is ready to dish out an exhilarating performance,” she said. “This tour ends a two-year absence due to the COVID-19-induced lockdowns that saw many countries close their borders. “Our last tour was in Bermuda at the beginning of 2020 before lockdown.” From the time it started, Nobuntu’s music has mellowed over the years attracting a myriad of followers across the globe. The group has evolved in the manner it dresses on stage in accordance with its growth as a brand. Its outfits vary from Xhosa, Ndebele, Venda, Swati to Herero ethnicity, as most of the group’s cultural elements are found in Zimbabwe. In a recent interview, Dube said their different costumes identified and blended with their story on stage. “We communicate our different life experiences through how we look. We are proudly African and we feel it through the manner in which we dress. “Many people love how we look on stage and that has pushed us to come up with a clothing range,” she said. Other venues where the group is set to perform include Sharon L Morse Performing Arts Center, Raymond F Kravis Centre for the Performing Arts, University of Massachusetts, Lake Placid Center of the Arts and TB Sheldon Performing Arts Theatre.
