THE High Court has declared that rice imports be exempted from double taxation, a move that will stop the government from collecting value added tax (VAT) from rice importers.  Taxing of rice imports had resulted in the prices of rice going up by 20% to 25%. Human rights activist, Vongai Zimudzi, through her lawyer Obey Shava had dragged Finance minister Mthuli Ncube and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) to court for double taxation of rice imports.
