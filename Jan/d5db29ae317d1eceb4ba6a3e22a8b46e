LOCAL gospel singer and music producer Forward Mazuruse  has been selected to be part of performers at the virtual tribute concert for the late South African Anglican archbishop and theologian, Desmond Mpilo Tutu on Sunday. To be part of the tribute concert, Mazuruse responded to an open global call for artistes to submit their compositions and his dedication to Tutu titled A song for Tutu, made the grade. Mazuruse will join a range of South African, Palestinian and international artistes at the concert being organised by Afro Arts South Africa, Palestine Festival South Africa, Discover TV and the Jo’burg Theatre. He told NewsDay Life & Style that being part of such a stellar line-up of performers was humbling especially in view of the strides he has made over the years. “I have not only played for some of the big names in Zimbabwe, but have produced and composed music that has been used by celebrated brands and organisations in the country. “The most recent one was a request by the Palestinian embassy in Zimbabwe that called for peace and co-existence in the Middle East,” he said. “My plan is to capitalise on this new high for more in-roads into the international market and festivals as we want to take Zimbabwean music out there.” Mazuruse recently released a video for his single Shamwari Yakanaka which is a precursor to his 2022 album. It has been well received by the market. His experience in the music industry spans close to two decades. Follow us on Twitter @NewsDayZimbabwe
