MDC Alliance national council member and activist Makomborero Haruziviishe has been granted $20 000 bail by the High Court ending his nine month incarceration. Haruziviishe was arrested last year and was charged for kidnapping after he locked the  Impala Car Rental premises accusing the company of aiding fellow activists’ abduction by leasing vehicles to State security agents. Allegations are that on October 15, 2020 at around 3pm, Haruziviishe, who was in company of Prince Gora and Youngerson Matete, who were also arrested over the case and others who are still at large, held Impala Motor Spares employees hostage. They protested, waving placards and denouncing the incarceration of student leader Takudzwa Ngadziore, the court heard. They allegedly used a chain and lock to secure the entrance to the shop, denying employees freedom. On July 15 last year, he was granted bail, but was detained due to pending cases.
