Premier Netball League (PNL) champions Platinum Queens are bracing for the commencement of the 2022 season. Coach Simbarashe Mlambo told NewsDay Sport that they had shifted focus to the team dynamics and team building as they intensify preparations. The Zvishavane side finished unbeaten with a remarkable victory of 79 points — six points ahead of the second-placed Harare City. Though it’s still off-season, Mlambo still believes that it’s not time to relax and take a back seat, but utilise this opportunity to strengthen the team. “We make sure that the girls are regularly training — hill runs, individual workouts and as a team we meet regularly to just make sure that we enjoy a game or two. It’s off-season, yes, but when you are an athlete you can’t be taking a break, not really. You just make sure that you maintain your body and that you are in shape and that is exactly what we are doing with the girls,” he said. “We are okay, we are not changing anything. We are just moving one or two people around and making sure that we have got diversity in the team and definitely just trying one or two positions and making sure that nobody plays just one position. It’s just a bit of dynamics and diversity we are adding to the team.” Mlambo said they had managed to bond as a group. “I still believe that when you want to win as a team, you have to make sure that you create a family and Platinum Queens is not just a team, it’s a family. We do everything in our power to make sure that our family stays strong and united towards a common goal. We just do everything together, we cry together, laugh together and we just make sure that we have got each other’s backs in the team — in court and off court.”
