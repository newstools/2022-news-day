BY SILAS NKALA/IRENE MOYO BULAWAYO’s water supply dams in the Umzingwane Catchment area recorded only 2,24% inflows as of January 18, despite the country experiencing heavy rains this month. In a notice to residents this week, Bulawayo town clerk Christopher Dube said the city had not had adequate inflows. “The global increase to date due to the recent rains is 2,24% of overall dam capacity,” Dube said. Insiza Mayfair received, 0,754%, with a cumulative actual of 1 308 554 880 cubic metres, Inyankuni 3,367% with cumulative actual of 2 72 056 00 and Lower Ncema 1,898% with cumulative actual of 1 440 370 00 cubic metres of water. Umzingwane received 0,270% with cumulative actual of 120 709 96 cubic metres, Upper Ncema 0,213% with cumulative actual of 96 918 00 cubic metres, and Mtshabezi got 6,928% with cumulative actual of 3 602 490 00 cubic metres of water — all totalling 9 289 098 84 cubic metres. This shows an improvement from January 16 when the cumulative inflows stood at 389 744 23 cubic metres of water. In 2020, Bulawayo experienced a serious water crisis resulting in some households, especially those in high-lying areas, going for over six months without water. The council resorted to water-shedding with suburbs getting supplies three days per week. As the water shortage persisted, a diarrhoea outbreak hit Luveve high-density suburb, killing at least 13 people with over 1 000 people hospitalised.
