MOFFAT Machingura, the author of Life Capsules for Success, will at the end of this month relaunch his other book titled How I Kissed Heartbreak Goodbye on his website. The book was first released in 2014 as a preliminary edition and was edited and relaunched in 2016. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style, Machingura said: “After I released the book in 2014, it went viral and people started sending in lots of relationship questions. It took me two years of compiling the questions and their answers and added them to chapter two of the book which was relaunched in 2016.” He said he predicted in the book that the world would turn into a “heartbreak café” and this motivated him to launch the book again. “It’s not just in Africa, even in the United States, studies are showing that an average person experiences a heartbreak before finding the right person,” he said. “In the book, I mentioned that the worst about heartbreak is not just the pain you feel, but the person it can make you become. “People are turning suicidal when they lose out in relationships. This book is a wake-up call; it shows everyone how finding love can stop feeling like a casino.” The book is meant to show people how to detect “fake” love before settling down. How I Kissed Heartbreak Goodbye has two parts with the first having 10 chapters, which focus on showing nine signs of heartbreak love, and part two has 100 best questions and answers on love relationships. Machingura believes his books can help in changing the world as Life Capsules for Success was read by over 100 000 readers worldwide.
