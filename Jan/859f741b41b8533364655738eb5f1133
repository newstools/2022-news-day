BY LORRAINE MUROMO THE Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (Artuz) yesterday said it would continue to demand fair remuneration despite the arrest of its members. Last Wednesday, 16 Artuz members were arrested as they demonstrated for better pay and working conditions. They were released on bail on Monday. The State accused the Artuz members of having an unsanctioned gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace and bigotry. Artuz president Obert Masaraure, who was among the arrested, said the association would keep fighting for restoration of their US$540 pre-2018 salaries. “The State only arrested our bodies, but our minds were free,” he said. Masaraure bemoaned the poor welfare of the majority of civil servants. “The salary situation of civil servants is just the same. We are fighting for those who arrested us, for those who are persecuting us and those who kept us here,” he said. ”The teachers spent the whole weekend caged at the notorious remand prison, which ended up having a sewer burst on Saturday night, within the D class section, forcing officers to transfer dangerous criminals to Harare Central Prison.”
