A MAN from Nyamandlovu in Bubi district, Matabeleland North province, nearly killed his neighbour in a fight over access to borehole water. The accused, Bekithemba Mpala (24) on Tuesday appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Elisha Singano to answer to an attempted murder charge. Mpala denied the charge and was remanded out of custody to tomorrow for continuation of trial. Allegations are that sometime in May 2021 at around 8am, Mpala assaulted Mqondisi Dube (38) following a heated argument over access to the borehole in Nyamandlovu. It is the State case that the two had an altercation at a borehole located at Mpala’s homestead where Dube sought to water his cattle. Mpala denied him access to the borehole. An argument ensued, resulting in Mpala striking Dube with an axe and knobkerrie. Dube’s aide Sidingani Sibanda (48) rushed to the scene and found Dube lying unconscious on the ground. The court was told that Dube had a deep cut on the forehead. Sibanda rushed him to Nyamandlovu Hospital where he was treated and referred to Mpilo Central Hospital. The matter was reported at Nyamandlovu Police Station, leading to Mpala’s arrest.
