BY Magreth Ruzvidzo The Zimbabwe senior women’s hockey team has qualified for the semi-finals at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Accra, Ghana, after drawing 1-1 with Namibia yesterday. This was their last pool match and they finished on second position behind defending champions South Africa. The ladies were drawn in the same group with South Africa, Uganda and Namibia and their semi-final opponents are yet to be determined. Zimbabwe had a bad start to the tournament, crashing to a 3-0 defeat against South Africa in their opening match on Monday. They, however, managed to recover from that early setback by hammering Uganda 5-0 in their second match. In yesterday’s match, Zimbabwe managed to take a lead in the 43rd minute through Tinodiwanashe Elijah. But the lead was shortlived as Taramarie Myburgh equalised for Namibia eight minutes later. The tournament started on Monday and will run until Sunday
