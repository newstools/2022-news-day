BULAWAYO-BASED hip-hop artiste Mninikhaya “BLECKHIT” Malunga says his music seeks to expose how “false prophets” manipulate and abuse women and  their involvement in corrupt activities. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, BLECKHIT accused “false prophets”  of fuelling gender-based violence (GBV) while pretending to be holy. “I am BLECKHIT because of my skin colour with a mind of giving hits in the music sphere. The main track that makes people remember me is Abaprofethi which talks about the wrong and false things that some of the prophets do and say,” he said. “I have also sung about corruption which made me win the CITE Voice for Change Competition last year. The track talks about how people who are occupying high positions in companies’ prey on our sisters.” The song also highlights how long people wait to hold a form to be allocated for housing stands while others just take bribes. It also unveils how bribery has taken place on the roadblocks.” He added; “I am not stopping as I will continue to put something on records that most people are failing to say out loud. Comforting, advising, motivating, and offering mental health services through art and music is what I do.” BLECKHIT said he will drop a new love song on 14 February titled loveable to celebrate love which he features with Agenda Maposa.
