ERIC BAILLY went from hero to zero as Mo Salah held his nerve to fire Egypt into the last-eight of the African Cup of Nations at the expense of Ivory Coast. The Manchester United defender was exceptional throughout as the two AFCON powerhouses battled to a goalless draw after 120 minutes. Nicolas Pepe struck first for Ivory Coast before Zizo blasted in Egypt’s opening kick. Ibrahim Sangare stepped up to convert as did Amr El Solia to make it 2-2 in a perfect start to spot-kicks for both teams. Then came the big moment as man of the match Bailly casually strode up to strike the ball. But his effort was too close to Gabaski, who dived to his right and stuck out his hand to push the ball onto the bar. The Zamalek keeper was an unlikely hero as he had only come on as substitute towards the end of the second half after Mohamed El Shenawy suffered a leg injury. – Sun
