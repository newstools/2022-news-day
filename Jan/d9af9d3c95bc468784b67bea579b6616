SHALE Clinic in Umzingwane district, Matabeleland South province, has remained closed since September last year after nurses fled the health institution due to alleged goblin attacks. Provincial medical director Ruth Chikodzore yesterday told NewsDay that recent efforts to re-open the clinic after a cleansing ceremony had hit a snag following fresh attacks. “The staff at the clinic wrote reports stating that they were being harassed by unknown creatures which they could not see, and they ended up abandoning the clinic staff accommodation. The incident occurred in September last year,” Chikodzore said. “The local community leaders are aware of the situation and they tried to do cleansing ceremonies, but there was no progress. The villagers are now going to Esibomvu Clinic for health services.” A villager, Lindokuhle Sibanda, appealed for help from traditional healers in the province to exorcise the clinic. Staff at Bezha Secondary School in Umzingwane district have experienced similar problems. In 2014, several parents transferred their children from Mzinyathini High School over Satanism claims.
