BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE THE City of Harare has partnered Augur Investments to renovate Warren Hills Golf Course which they want to be a world-class 18-hole golf course, including the driving range and club house. The golf club has been lying idle for several years due to neglect. In a statement, City of Harare acting chamber secretary Warren Chiwewe said the golf course was owned by Sunshine Developments, a joint venture company between the local authority and Augur Investments. Under the joint venture agreement, the City of Harare will provide land and Sunshine Development will contribute US$7 million for development. Augur Investments chief executive Kenneth Raydon Sharpe  said: “We are currently working on development plans for the golf course. We believe we, as private developers, will make it world-class.” He said they had engaged Peter Macintosh, a top designer of golf courses in Africa, to redesign the golf course.
