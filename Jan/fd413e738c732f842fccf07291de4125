IN what could be one of the biggest transfer coups this year, ambitious Premier Soccer League side Bulawayo Chiefs are angling to lure Warriors and FC Platinum shot stopper Petros Mhari. The 32-year-old goalie is said to be out of contract after his deal with FC Platinum lapsed last month. And Bulawayo Chiefs are waiting with their claws open to grab the veteran goalie, as the club assembles a cast of experienced players to work with Portuguese coach Nilton Terreso. “Chiefs want Petros, who might be leaving FC Platinum. It’s not yet clear, but the club has already met the player and presented their offer,” a source told NewsDay Sport yesterday. Mhari has been a key asset for the Norman Mapeza-coached club since joining from Hwange in 2013. Nevertheless, if he leaves, that would present a window of opportunity for Wallace Magalane, who had been playing second fiddle. It has remained unclear what has forced several key men at FC Platinum to decide against extending their stay in Zvishavane. Some of the players who have left include Ralph Kawondera, Silas Songani, Rahman Kutsanzira, Kelvin Madzongwe and Denzel Khumalo. NewsDay Sport understands that the club is on a smooth drive to integrate some of its players from the developmental side competing in the Zifa Central Region into the senior team. They have since co-opted into the senior team Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya, Oscar Bhebhe, Panashe Matimbanyoka, Hagaizo Magaya and Kelvin Mangiza, who have all proved to be competent enough to last the distance in the Premiership. Meanwhile, Walter Musona rejoined the club following a brief stint on the sidelines after he was offloaded by South Africa’s Sekhukune United.
