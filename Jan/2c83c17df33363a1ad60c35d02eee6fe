BY AGATHA CHUMA POPULAR dancehall crooner Freeman, born Energy Slyvesta Chizanga on Wednesday dropped the official video for his latest release, Robbery, plucked off his 10th album with the same title. The album was released late last year. The video was dropped on his official channel, the Record Label in the morning, and garnered over 100K views on YouTube within 24 hours. The song’s message that is well complemented with the visuals exhibits what people can do for the sake of love. Freeman released the Robbery video shot by Charlie.Shot.Me and produced by Cymplex in time for Valentine’s Day, which is just around the corner. In the video, Freeman plays a guy who was offered an opportunity to join a robbery crew by his friend, but he initially hesitantly refused to take the offer. Upon meeting his girlfriend and finding out that her relative was sick and she could not afford to buy the medication, Freeman willingly went back to join the mafia gang, but ran out of luck as he was later caught and arrested by the police. The line “nekuda kwerudo ndachinja kuita criminal” (because of love I have decided to be a criminal) shows that Freeman had to sacrifice for his girlfriend to become a criminal. In the video, he is not even blaming the girl for getting him arrested, but instead promised marriage upon release from the prison. The Robbery video which features founder and chairman of Nash Paints Tinashe Mutarisi is already trending on different social media with prominent artistes like Jah Prayzah applauding Freeman for great works on the production. On the Robbery album, Freeman featured fellow dancehall singers Tocky Vibes and Daruler. The album was recorded, mixed and mastered by two record labels, Sunshine Family Studios and Cymplex Music.
