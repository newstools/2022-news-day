BY TERRY MADYAUTA Herentals star player Kelvin Bingala has joined Botswana Premier League side Orapa United. Terms of his contract with the financial stable club were not disclosed but his manager Gilbert Sengwe confirmed the move. “Kelvin Bingala now a Orapa player he left Herentals. He joins them after spending six months at Herentals following his return from Zambia where he was playing for Lumwana Radiants,” Sengwe said. Orapa United is also the former club for ex-Dynamos forward Christian Epoupa. Bingala, though, will hope to have a longer stay in Botswana compared to his previous stint across Zimbabwe’s board when he played for Lumwana Radiants in Zambia. He left Zambia in a huff together with former Caps United forward Dominic Chungwa who also moved to Flamingoes in Botswana. His manager, Sengwe added: “He (Bingala) was at Herentials FC before I organised a deal for him together with Dominic Chungwa to Lumwana Radiants of Zambia the team was relegated so I asked him come to rejoin Herentials FC for 6 months. “That was meant for him to keep fit then now after his contract with Herentials expired on 31 December I got a deal for him at Orapa of Botswana a club being sponsored by a Diamond Mining Company.”
