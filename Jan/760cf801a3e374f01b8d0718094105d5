Producer and journalist Margret Chirairo believes her debut reality show, Auntie Maggie Show, that premiered on YouTube on Monday will transform the marriage institution as several couples share their marital problems and proffer solutions. Chirairo, who is affectionately known as the Queen Mother, told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that she had been contemplating embarking on the project since 2016 and was pushed by people who sought marital advice from her. “I have always had people who came to me seeking advice. I said to myself, ‘Maggie, if people trust you with their stories, can’t you see that you are their aunt?’ That prompted me to come up with the show which I believe will be the voice of the voiceless and a platform to resolve people’s disputes,” she said. “Getting married at a younger age opened my eyes to particularly have an insight on the marriage institution. I have heard and seen a lot about marriage which I felt needed to be told. Some of my friends divorced in less than three years of marriage because they couldn’t stomach what they were experiencing. So the show is about marriage problems and possible solutions.” Queen Mother believes she was born a counsellor. “I was named after my aunt who was the only daughter in my father’s family. So growing up, my father used to call me aunt. My surname Chirairo resonates with the motive of the show. It means an adviser. So I believe that I was born to be a marriage counsellor,” she said. “I am grateful for the financial support that I received from my husband Kasirai Mudawu and parents.” The first episode featured Mai Banda — pseudonym — who had been married for over 20 years and kept a secret that she had a child outside wedlock. Her then husband got to know about the child. In a fit of rage, the husband deserted the matrimonial home and never came back.
