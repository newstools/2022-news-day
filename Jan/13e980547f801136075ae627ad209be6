BULAWAYO model Roland Mzamba has said Africa is rich in culture and tradition, something that has inspired him to join the modelling industry. The model said his venturing into the modelling industry was motivated by his love for the camera as well as the desire to tell the African story through art. “For one to have an appreciation of Africa, it can only be done by having an imagination about Africa,” Mzamba told NewsDay Life & Style. Mzamba made his debut on the ramp in 2020 when he participated at the Victoria Falls Arts Festival. He has also featured in three magazines — Vic Falls Magazine, Model Square and Model Pride. “I graduated from Infinni Talent Management, previously known as Truth Model Agency, in Bulawayo,” he said. “I am in the process of creating my style and I also want to participate in this year’s Mr Zimbabwe International pageantry,” Mzamba said, boasting of being able to succeed in the modelling industry considering that it is an industry dominated by women. “It’s quite amazing to be in the industry although it has its own ups and downs, but you have to try and create your own style that you can be easily identified with especially if you are coming from a small city.” He, however, lamented lack of financial support as the major challenge he has been facing.
