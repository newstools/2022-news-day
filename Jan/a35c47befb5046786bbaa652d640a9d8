A large number of women gathered at main bus stand and closed the busy road linking Bannu with Mianwali district of Punjab. The protesters were holding placards inscribed with slogans against gas and electricity load-shedding. The closure of road for nearly five hours troubled pedestrians and motorists. Women speakers said that excessive gas and electricity outages had added to their problems as they could not maintain housekeeping effectively. “We face a lot of problems while preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner as the facilities remains suspended most time of the day and night,” they claimed. They asked the government to take notice of unscheduled load-shedding being carried out in Lakki Marwat city. Area elders and councillors-elect also joined the protest.
