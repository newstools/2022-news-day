PREMIER Soccer League giants Caps United’s bosses are struggling to pay the players, who are owed three months’ salaries, ahead of resumption of training on Wednesday. The players have not been paid their October, November and December salaries, which forced some of the team’s league matches to be shelved last month after they boycotted training. A club official yesterday told NewsDay Sport that things were returning to normal at the club, with the bosses, Farai Jere and Nhamo Tutisani, committing to settling everything they owe the players and technical staff. Given the financial problems at the club, the Green Machine could lose a number of players who may leave in search of greener pastures. As they prepare to return to work since the postponement of their league match against army side Black Rhinos after they boycotted training owing to the standoff with the club hierarchy, the official said the club was close to securing funds to finance at least two months’ salaries for players to be paid before Wednesday, with training set to resume. Training, though, can only kick off after players have undergone the routine COVID-19 tests. “Of course, it has been tough for the club, but I can tell you the issue will be resolved soon. Players will be paid at least two months’ salaries this week after which training will resume possibly on Wednesday. Things are slowly getting to normal,” the official said. Caps United have so far not signed any new players, while their arch-rivals Dynamos have announced the capture of Brendon Mpofu, Evans Katema and Ralph Kawondera. A number of players are out of contract and are negotiating with other teams, while Caps United is fighting to survive. Some of the players that could leave are Leroy Mavhunga, captain Ronald Chitiyo and Tatenda Tumba, to mention just but three.
