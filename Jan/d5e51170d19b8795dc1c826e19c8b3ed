By Alicia Pistis Nduna Your love is like an island In a lifeless ocean, Made of deep devotion and sacrifice. My first country l lived in In you l was created And for me you were created. You are charming your food is enchanting but your love is everlasting. Strong as a lion , fearless as lioness pure as a dove. So many stars in the sky but yours shines brighter sometimes l ask myself where l would be today without your motherly advice ultimate sacrifices All my sorrows washed away like make up on a widow’s face because of  your presence You turned me into sunshine, Today where ever l go My light shines bright You encouraged me to dream Fostering and nurturing the Seeds of ubuntu in me l am because you are. In my battles You are my soldier In darkness You showed me light When l thought that l wouldn’t make it You gave me strength and courage In hopelessness you showed me a ray of hope How to dance in the storm you taught me I have crossed so many bridges of life Because of you You always give me a reason To: Breath Smile Laugh Your sweet voice brings happiness in my life Your eyes brighten my days Words aren’t enough to say thank you mom
