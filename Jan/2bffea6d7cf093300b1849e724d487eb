Afro-soul musician Plaxedes Wenyika says her latest album titled Phoenix Rising released at the end of last year heralded a comeback that has culminated in bigger things in the new year. Plaxedes made a return to the music scene in November last year with the launch of her seventh album Phoenix Rising after a four-year sabbatical. Known for dishing out a string of classic love ballads, including Wadarirei, Hapana Angandida Sewe and Tisaparadzane, Plaxedes had last released a song (Now I Know) in 2017. Yesterday she told NewsDay Life & Style that her latest album coupled by two videos of songs — Hewo Moyo Wangu and Feel Your Love — heralded her comeback. “Plaxedes Wenyika (The Queen) is back. 2022 is going to be an exciting and eventful year,” Plaxedes said. “I am looking forward to more music collaborations with local and international artistes and I will release more singles and another album later in the year. “As an influencer I will be working with different corporate brands.” Plaxedes was thrust into the spotlight four years ago after she divorced businessman Mike Joka, whom she had been married to for 13 years. She said she had picked up, dusted herself and was using that experience to motivate others, especially women. “On the motivational side, I will be spreading and teaching more self-awareness and self-love for women to build their confidence and body positivity. “I intend to host feel good classes for women,” Plaxedes said. “In terms of business, I intend to increase my footprint and market share for my various businesses. I hope Zimbabwe and the world is ready. The Phoenix has risen.” Some of the songs on her latest album include Rise of the Phoenix, Nguva Ichipo, Feel Your Love, Old School Loving, Nzvimbo Yekupotera and Keep the Faith.
