Premier Soccer League basement side WhaWha are set to plunge into tomorrow’s clash against Herentals at the National Sports Stadium with a makeshift forward line-up in the absence of the club‘s top scorer Jayden Barake and captain Albert Matewu who are suspended. Barake and last weekend’s two-goal hero Albert Matewu will miss this crucial match, leaving the aging Tineyi Chitora as their only available option to stir the strike force. Barake is suspended because he accumulated the maximum number of yellow cards in consecutive matches. WhaWha will be without Matewu after he was red-carded last Saturday in a match he scored a brace during the victory over Highlanders. Barake’s absence will be the biggest blow for the prison wardens as he has established himself as the club’s mainstay in this current campaign despite their struggles. The 19-year-old is one of the league’s top goal scorers, with seven goals for the club, just three behind the leading scorer William Manondo. However, coach Luke Petros is hoping the available players will fill in the void and maintain their winning spirit against Herentals. “It is the character and good spirit that matters to us at this point. We have faced so many challenges, of which we overcame some of them, hence the desire to be better. We are in this position but there is hope for us to remain in the Premiership when the season ends. Mathematically it can be difficult to predict but we still have a chance,” Petros said.
