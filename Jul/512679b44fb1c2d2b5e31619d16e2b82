SCIENTISTS have suggested that outbreaks from edible snail consumption may be going undetected in Cameroon. Researchers detected Campylobacter, Yersinia, Listeria, Salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E coli in snails in Cameroon. African land snails are a source of food for many people in sub-Saharan Africa because of their protein. In Cameroon, no data on pathogens in snail meat are available, and their role in causing enteric diseases in the local population is unknown, but live snails are sold in most local markets in the country.  — Food Safety News
