BLACK RHINOS coach Herbert Maruwa believes Caps United’s win last weekend means the Green Machine will be fired up when they face off in a Castle Lager Premiership tie on Saturday. The Green Machine scored twice through striker William Manondo to edge Harare City 2-1 last Sunday, their first win in eight matches. That victory lifted them to 12th position on the league table with 20 points after 19 matches.  And Marawa believes that big win could work against the army side because Caps would be more confident. Rhinos are not in bad shape themselves, and go into the match after their hard fought 2-1 victory over Herentals in Rusape took them to seventh place on the standings with 29 points. “Caps United are coming from a win against Harare City and their heads are high. Their position on the log has nothing to do with the Saturday game.  It’s not going to be an easy game for us. They are a big institution capable of rising to the occasion more so after their great result against Harare City,” he said. The unassuming Black Rhinos coach said the Herentals game was in the past and they have since shifted their focus to Caps United. “The game we played against Herentals is now water under the bridge. We are now focusing on our next game against caps United. We need to play our normal game and make sure we get something out of the match. We are ready for the challenge and we need to make sure mentally we are prepared for the challenge,” he said. Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe on the other hand knows another victory could set the tone for the rest of the campaign. The Green Machine, who have been facing financial challenges have their spirits lifted after the club hierarchy paid playing staff outstanding salaries. Top goal scorer William Manondo appears to have regained his potency in front of goal after scoring both goals in that crucial victory against Harare City.
