IT might sound funny, but it is a fact, film writer Joseph Dzatsata’s experience as a security guard was the source of inspiration behind the Smoking Gun series storyline. Dzatsata told NewsDay Life & Style that his encounter with some machete-wielding robbers and the experiences of other victims of robbery inspired him to write the crime series. “Through the series I hope to shine a light on the ripple effects of the crimes happening in society. By digging deeper into these robberies, I wanted to show that it takes everyone to stop these crimes, not just the police,” he said. “I am happy that the series has been well received on the showbiz scene. From the positive comments on our social media platforms, it seems the public has been waiting for such a storyline.” Dzatsata said when he partnered Eastlife Entertainment Studios, the vision was to bring his robbery experience to life in all its elements. “I believe we have abundant talent in the country that can compete with Nollywood, but we only lack the requisite resources to outshine them. Financial constraints are the major drawback that is deterring the industry from reaching its highest levels. My belief is that if we partner with the corporate community, we can grow the industry to even contribute to the country’s gross domestic product,” he added. Apart from the Smoking Gun series, Dzatsata has also written other films that include Caged, Effect and Quo Tendimus, currently showing in Mutare cinemas. Dzatsata said he has partnered Stephan Mutsago to co-write a feature action movie titled Comrade to be released on Heroes Day, if all goes according to the script.
