AS food shortage grips many parts of the world, with the United Nations warning of “an unprecedented global hunger crisis,” China’s success story in grain self-sufficiency might help soothe the frayed market nerve. Deemed the world’s largest grain producer, China has secured a bumper wheat yield in the summer harvest, which traditionally accounts for one-fifth of its annual grain output. It has also completed nearly 80% of summer sowing of corn and other crops. Securing such mammoth production is anything but easy, as Omicron flare-ups had disrupted the spring farming earlier this year and snarled up traffic when crop harvesters rumbled across the country for summer harvest. —  Xinhua
