AMBITIOUS Gweru-based side, Sheasham are one foot into the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League after opening a five-point lead in the Central Region Division One promotion race, with five games remaining before the curtain comes down on the season. The Construction Boys, as Sheasham are affectionately known, have spent the better part of this campaign on the summit of the log, with hopes of maintaining their spot in this home stretch. And as it stands they are the natural favourites to win championship albeit stiff competition from their closest rivals TelOne, who are also hopeful of booking a slot in the topflight league. Sheasham thumped Bishopstone 6-0 at the weekend to stretch their lead at the top of the log standings with 49 points, while the WiFi Boys were held by Zvishavane side Loss Control, dampening their hopes of reducing the gap. Although Sheasham are well on course to win the title, coach John Nyikadzino has remained grounded, emphasising that they must not get overexcited by the current
circumstances. The next fixtures will, however, be stern tests for both title hopefuls, with assignments that could be potential banana skins in their path. On Saturday, Sheasham will travel to Kwekwe for a date with the Godfrey Tamirepi-coached ZPC Munyati, while TelOne will endure a gruelling trip to Matebeleland South to face Filabusi United.
