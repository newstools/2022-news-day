After parting ways with Baroka FC, Zimbabwean goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze is expected to sign with a new club almost immediately. Following his four-year stay with Bakgaga since arriving from Zimbabwe’s Chicken Inn FC in 2018, Chipezeze has been affected by the changes at the Limpopo outfit after the team’s relegation from the topflight at the end of the 2021/22 season. With his clearance in hand, the shot-stopper’s handlers have started negotiations with newly-promoted Richards Bay, regarding a possible deal. The 32-year-old was spotted with his representative and Richards Bay boss Sifiso “Jomo” Biyela having discussions at a location in Gauteng. “Elvis Chipezeze is in talks with Richards Bay to join them for the new season. He is a free agent after leaving Baroka FC. The negotiations are at an advanced stage,” said the source. —  SoccerLaduma
