THERE is no sign of the increasing cost of living in South Africa slowing down, as the effects of a global hike in food prices are exacerbated by rolling blackouts in the country. AgriSA, the biggest federation of agricultural organisations in South Africa, said the impact of ongoing power outages on the agricultural sector and the wider economy holds serious implications for food security in the country. High food prices have been commonplace globally, according to the UBS Agriculture outlook. The war in Ukraine, government interventions in markets, high energy prices, labour issues, and persistent climate-related challenges all contribute to the sector struggling to keep costs manageable. —Businesstech
