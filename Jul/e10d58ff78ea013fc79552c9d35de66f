Johannesburg — South African Premier Soccer League side SuperSport United have responded to the recent rumours that the club is close to being sold. On Tuesday, new reports made rounds on social media that Zimbabwean billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is set to take over the club, subject to approval from the Premier Soccer league executive committee. Meanwhile, another consortium connected to Wits was linked to a potential takeover at the club but according to South African journalist Maskepe Matsebane, Masiyiwa is closing in on acquiring the club ahead of the 2022/23 season. However, SuperSport have denied those reports in a “club update” that was sent to the players and staff and since seen by iDiski Times. “SuperSport United has been made aware of the old repeated rumours and speculation regarding the potential sale of the club,” the statement read. “Please note that these rumours are completely untrue. As stated when these false rumours started in 2019, the club is not for sale. “The club is seeking legal advice on the publications or persons involved in continually issuing these false statements.” SuperSport has been rumoured to be sold for the last few years but club CEO Stan Matthews has continuously denied those rumours in public. — iDiski Times
