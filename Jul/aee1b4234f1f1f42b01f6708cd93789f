FC PLATINUM coach Norman Mapeza has warned his players to guard against complacency when they host ZPC Kariba in the league match at Mandava Stadium tomorrow. Mapeza wants his men to maintain their spotless record as they have not conceded in eight matches, with seven wins and a draw, a streak that has strengthened their title ambitions. The platinum miners are the best performers so far in the top-flight, sitting pretty at the summit of the standings. And the veteran mentor is keen to safeguard the record as they angle to account for their fourth title on the trot. “We are doing good as a team, but we still need to push hard. We have to focus on the next assignment and hope for a positive result. ZPC is a good team, we cannot underestimate them because they will come here to win. We are ready and the preparations have gone well on our side and the boys are raring to go,” Mapeza said. The Warriors mentor acknowledges the threat posed by the electricity-men, despite their struggles of late on and off the field. The Rodwell Dhlakama-coached side sits just above relegation with 22 points and a superior goal difference to that of Cranborne Bullets, who occupy the first relegation slot with the same number of points. For the platinum miners, three players Petros Mhari, William Stima and Hagiazo Magaya remain sidelined due to injuries.
