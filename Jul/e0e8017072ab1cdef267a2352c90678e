MILLIONS of subsistence farmers in the Mpondoland region of the former Transkei are being sidelined because of the legalisation of cannabis and hemp production. Greekson Zweni, director and chairperson of the Umzimvubu Farmers’ Support Network, said the legalisation of cannabis for personal use was taking its toll on traditional cannabis farmers in the Eastern Cape due to lower prices. Since the Constitutional Court ruled in 2018 that the use, possession and cultivation of cannabis in private dwellings was not illegal, prices had fallen from about R2 000 per 20ℓ container to R200. —  Farmers Weekly
