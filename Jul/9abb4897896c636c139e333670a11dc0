PROVOCATIVE comedienne Felistas “Mai Titi” Murata is not new to controversy and appears to have mastered the art of going live on Facebook whenever she feels offended. Well, at times she, however, engages in these Facebook posts just for the fun of it. But most of the time Mai Titi just appears to have a penchant for online beefs with multiple people, not only celebrities. In the latest development, she has torched a brouhaha fighting with those she described as her “haters” over birthday gifts. On Monday, Mai Titi threw a thunderbolt in a Facebook live post to another controversial character, Tatenda “Tatelicious” Karigambe and actress cum writer Joey Tana Nyikadzino. The duo angered Mai Titi after they rubbished claims that her husband Tinashe Maphosa had bought her a house and a car as birthday presents. Tatelicious, who joined in Mai Tit’is Facebook live chat, said the car belonged to Nyikadzino. Responding to Tatelicious, a visibly angry Mai Titi said: “I buy cars and houses while you sell a car and a house. We are not on the same level, me and you.” Mai Titi ridiculed Nyikadzino and Tatelicious claiming that she was making them relevant by engaging them on her live show. “Last time you went around telling people that my husband is cheating on me and buying you gifts and asking you out. “I respected and approached you privately, but you are stubborn,” she thundered to Nyikadzino. Of late, Mai Titi has been embroiled in heated confrontations with fellow comedian Tarisai Tyra “Madam Boss” Chikocho and a self-proclaimed prophet, Passion Java who owns a record label named after him. Earlier this year, Mai Titi was also embroiled in another nasty exchange of words with Olinda Chapel on Instagram on accusations of infidelity.
