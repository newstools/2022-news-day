FC PLATINUM gaffer Norman Mapeza has warned his side not to be complacent when they face unpredictable Bulawayo Chiefs at Mandava Stadium tomorrow. The defending champions have won their last six league matches without conceding heading into the clash. But Mapeza reckons that form counts for very little in football, especially considering previous experience against the Bulawayo team. Chiefs handed FC Platinum their first defeat of the season and that is enough warning to the table toppers. Bulawayo Chiefs’ spine has its roots at the Zvishavane side and Mapeza is well aware of the threat that they pose. The veteran gaffer, however, feels comforted by his team’s current form and insatiable desire to win. “It’s very encouraging and it feels good to have a bunch of players who are willing to win football matches. As a coach, I am more than happy with their desire and hunger to win games,” he said. Having won their last three matches on the trot away to Cranborne Bullets, Tenax and Chicken Inn, Mapeza is hoping for a joyful homecoming. “We had very difficult games away from home, but we managed to come back home with maximum points. That has given us an edge in our preparations, though we have some other guys who are still out. “We shifted all focus to this game on Saturday against Bulawayo Chiefs who themselves are a quality side. For me, what matters is that we approach this game with the same mentality as we have been in previous matches.” The veteran gaffer refused to be drawn into commenting about the winning title, saying his focus was on developing players he parachuted into the first team this season. The match will mark a return to Mandava Stadium for some of the most celebrated players in Zvishavane who are now in the ranks of Chief. These are Kelvin Madzongwe, Perfect Chikwende, Elvis and Kelvin Moyo. This will be their first time return to the small mining on a competitive note since leaving the club.
