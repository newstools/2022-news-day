IN a bid to boost food production, the Nigeria Institute of Soil Science (NISS) has unveiled a mobile app, NISS Agro App, for farmers and extension agents to promote their activities and access to the market. NISS disclosed this during training on the app for stakeholders drawn from North-Western states which was held in Kano. The Institute’s Northwest Zonal coordinator, Sama’ila S Noma noted that the ICT agriculture tool was developed by NISS to ensure the best and standard practices in farming. Represented by a professor of soil science, Nafiu Abdu, Noma described the app as user-friendly, adding that it was developed to help farmers properly manage the use of soil and to boost agricultural production. Noma stated that: “NISS is an organisation entrusted with the mandate of ensuring the quality of soil in Nigeria, that is, how the fertility of the soil is maintained for efficient and sustainable crop production.”   – Tribune Online
