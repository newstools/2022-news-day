FOOD Reserve Agency executive director Chola Kafwabulula says the agency has not revised the maize purchase price from K160 to K180 due to public pressure, but out of respect for farmers. Last week, FRA announced that the White Maize purchase price had been revised from K160 to K180 per 50kg bag, which therefore supersedes the earlier announcement made on June 16. And in an interview, Kafwabulula said the government did not want the farmers to be discouraged hence the decision to empower them with a better price. – Diggers News
