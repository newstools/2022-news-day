ORGANISERS of the Matabeleland Cultural Awards (MCA) are calling for nominations for the annual awards that seek to honour those who preserve Zimbabwean cultures. The awards, to be held at the end of October, seek to uplift cultural players to ensure continuity and preservation of local culture for future generations. “We are taking this direction to organise the awards so as to appreciate the works of the cultural players for embracing culture and customs of different people in the country,” the awards chairperson, Philani Ncube said. “We want to honour cultural players in this part of the country for the job they are doing to continue reviving cultural norms and values for all tribes. We, therefore, want to encourage all tribes from this part of the country to be proud of who they are.” The annual awards were launched in 2019 and mainly target traditional dance groups, carvers, maskandi, traditional regalia designers, traditional foods cookers, Imbube, local indigenous languages authors, rural huts painters, weavers, potters and poetry among others. “We launched MCA to honour artists in Matabeleland and Midlands for their outstanding achievements in the region,” he said.
