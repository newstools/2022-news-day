ELEVEN out of 19 Mutare city councillors were nabbed by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission on Wednesday on charges of abuse of office after they allegedly defied Local Government minister July Moyo’s directive on allowances. The councillors stand accused of inflating their sitting allowances. Mayor Simon Chabuka from the Citizens Coalition for Change yesterday handed himself to police at Mutare Central Police Station after confirming the arrest of his colleagues. “Yes we have 11 councillors who have been arrested over reportedly defying a ministerial directive on allowances,” Chabuka said. The councillors, represented by prominent Mutare lawyer Christopher Ndlovu, were set to appear in court yesterday. The Local Government minister has been accused of destabilising local councils including Harare City Council.
