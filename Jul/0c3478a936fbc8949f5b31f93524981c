SOUTH Africa’s agriculture sector in general continues to display positive growth when measured in terms of output, exports and the creation of employment. In 2020, the sector grew 13,4% year-on-year, and the forecasts for 2021 also suggest growth. Primary agricultural employment has remained relatively steady since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 868 000 people employed in the fourth quarter of 2021, and export activity reaching a record level of US$12,4 billion (about R180 billion) in 2021. Despite this positive overall picture, some industries within the sector, such as sugar, have experienced difficulties.— Farmers Weekly
