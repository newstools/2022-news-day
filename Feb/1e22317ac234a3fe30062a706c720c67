IT is not everyday that one comes across an engineer who doubles up as a model, as both professions are demanding and time consuming. This is the life of Bulawayo-based Saymore “Von Klate” Machoni, who was crowned Mr Zimbabwe Fitness at a contest held in Harare recently. He is studying for an engineering degree at the National University of Science and Technology. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Von Klate said he was testimony that where one comes from does not determine his or her destination. “Many often wonder how I juggle between school and modelling. Most people ask why I am chasing a career in modelling when I am studying for a degree in engineering because they are unrelated, I always tell them that it is what makes me unique,” he said. “I have featured in a couple of music videos including Show Stopper by Bhekiwe and also represented Zimbabwe in the Man of the Earth competition which was held in Turkey about three months ago and it was a memorable experience for me.” Von Klate said his friends and family were his support base. “I would like to thank my family members who have always shown me great support and my manager Khaya Pardon as well as all the people who have voted for me whenever I needed votes,” he said. “There is a lot more on the cards this year as I will be dipping into acting as well, so it is going to be an interesting year.” Some of the titles currently held by Von Klate include Mr Truth. He is ambassador for B K’s boutique and ambassador for Hair Doctor Legendary Cuts in Bulawayo. The King of the Water Games, as he has been nicknamed by fellow models and local designers for his often-squeaky clean image, Von Klate was born in Mpopoma, Bulawayo where he grew up.
