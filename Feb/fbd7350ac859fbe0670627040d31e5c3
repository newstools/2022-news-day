WHILE most Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs are signing seasoned players, Luke Petros and his WhaWha technical team have settled for modest and unheralded players from lower leagues. Not that they don’t want experienced players in their team, but their small purse forced them to settle for second best. What gives them confidence is that they retained the rest of their squad from last year except defender Nyasha Gurende who crossed the floor to Bulawayo City last month. “We managed to retain most of our first team players except for Gurende, who has moved to Bulawayo City,” club secretary-general Innocent Makoni told NewsDay Sport yesterday. “We enlisted a number of players that included King Utete formerly with Black Rhinos. “There is also Utho Phiri and Carlos Muzanago, who joined us from the now defunct ZRP Gweru.” Gurende was undoubtedly their best performer before the PSL season was halted for the Christmas break. However, they are hoping to get a replacement among their new acquisitions, especially 20-year-old Diverlash Nyamukondiwa who they have touted as their next best thing. “We also got first-time registration and we got Nyamukondiwa. This one could be the player to watch if all goes well. “He also comes along with Johnstone Chapfika, Phil Boka and another young player coming from Bikita academy,” Makoni added.
