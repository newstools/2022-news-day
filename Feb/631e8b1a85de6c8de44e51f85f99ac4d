NGEZI Platinum have parted ways with coach Rodwell Dhlakama nine days before the Premier Soccer League resumes, with former Shabanie gaffer Takesure Chiragwi taking over on interim basis. In a statement, the club said Dhlakama has been placed on an indefinite leave, however the NewsDay Sport understands that the two parties severed ties. Why the former Chapungu coach has been sent packing remains a mystery at this point, especially looking at the coach’s track record since appointment at the tail end of 2019. The former Young Warriors man had transformed the team, breathing in hope of winning a PSL title which has remained elusive for the ambitious club. His main highlight at Madamburo was leading them to the Chibuku Super Cup final where they agonisingly lost to FC Platinum after penalty shootouts. Club Chief Executive Nyasha Kadenge confirmed the development in a statement released on Thursday morning. “We confirm that the Ngezi Platinum Stars Football Club Board has appointed Takesure Chiragwi as the Interim  Head  Coach  of Takesure Chiragwi with  immediate  effect. “Before  this appointment, Takesure Chiragwi was the First Assistant Coach of the Club. “Rodwell Dhlakama, the Head Coach, is on a mutually agreed indefinite leave of absence which has given rise to the appointment of Chiragwi. “We are confident that Takesure Chiragwi is well equipped to lead the team as we resume PSL football action after the AFCON break,” reads the statement. Chiragwi will lead a technical team that includes Cosmas ‘Tsano’ Zulu and Alexio Sigion.
