With Egypt set to take on Cameroon in the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals, one of the host nation’s standout performers has claimed that Mohamed Salah does not impress him. The much-anticipated fixture has already sparked a bit of controversy, with the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) having formally protested the Confederation of African Football’s decision to elect Gambian referee Bakary Gassama to officiate their titanic clash against the Indomitable Lions, with one EFA member deeming him “untrustworthy”. Earlier this week, Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz also criticised the president of the Cameroonian Football Federation Samuel Eto’o for telling his national team players to prepare for “war” against The Pharaohs. Cameroon’s star striker and captain Vincent Aboubakar has now seemingly twisted the knife ahead of the much-anticipated match by claiming that he does not rate the seven-time Afcon champions’ main man Salah. Asked by Radio France Internationale for his views on the Liverpool star ahead of their fixture, the 30-year-old said: “I see it as before. He is having a great season in the Premier League, he is helping his country to advance in the competition “I wish him a lot of luck. May the best win! “He doesn’t impress me much. I say it clearly because I’m an honest person and I have my way of seeing things. “If he impressed me, I would say so. But he doesn’t impress me much. He’s a good player, he scores a lot but he doesn’t produce a lot of stuff in the game. “Of course, he’s doing good stuff in the Premier League because he’s been in a team that’s been there for years. He’s a good player but not at the level of some like (Kylian) Mbappe.” – kickoff
