DANCEHALL musician Ameen Jaleel Matanaga, known as Poptain in the music circles said his forthcoming four track Extended Play titled Redemption to be dropped on February 11 has been inspired by life experience. Speaking through his manager Stanford Joni, Poptain said this year they will be releasing a lot of music. “The EP is inspired by what I have been through, if you listen to the songs you will get to understand how much I appreciate my maker, redemption to me is being redeemed from human worship, but giving thanks and appreciation to almighty God,” he said. “In this month of love, we have prepared something special for the ladies. Hopefully will give joy to the people who have supported Poptain over the years because we know they have been waiting for what we are giving them this year.” On the EP, the Fadza Mutengi hitmaker has enlisted the services of top producers across record labels who have a history of making hit songs. “We have a good working chemistry with Rodney Beatz who did a song called Mbabvu Yangu, with Shamex on the guitar who works at Military Touch,” he said. “Cymplex did a song called Tenda Wandiona. We always produce something big when we meet. The song Tenda Wandiona is a very promising track since we have a good working relationship with Cymplex as we always give people what they want, and yes big songs have come from working with him.” He added; “The song Only You features BongoBeats. He loved my art after we had spoken to open mic productions when we visited South Africa some time ago.” “Veteran producer T-Man of Mount Zion whom I have worked with over the years produced the song Nguva Yareba. Poptain said they have a large body of works that has accumulated over the years and what is left is the release of the works. “We have hundreds of unreleased songs so Poptain has been working very hard and still working daily,” he said.
