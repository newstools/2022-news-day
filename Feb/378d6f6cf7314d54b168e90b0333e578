HOME of Arts Entertainment (HAE) has said preparations for the forthcoming King and Queen of Pumula modelling contest were at an advanced stage. The pageant has been set for February 12 at Isilwane Youth Centre in Pumula. HAE and Pumula Royal Arts Competitions Awards (PRACAs) executive director Happy Mpofu told NewsDay Life & Style that through the pageant, they seek to give a platform to rising models to showcase their talents. “The modelling contest aims at giving exposure to the models in a competitive and innovative way and to help identify them for the upcoming Pumula Royal Arts Competitions Awards and other initiatives to be hosted by Home of Arts Entertainment,” she said. “I am looking forward to seeing more young people attending this initiative as we are planning to develop it to city level. Winners will also be proudly awarded,” said Mpofu without stating the prizes. Mpofu said the audience would pay US$2 and US$5 for ordinary and VIP tickets, respectively, adding that the show would be high-profile featuring celebrities like Nqobile Dube known as Poly Da Nqoe, who will be launching his album titled Uthando-Love. The focal person for artists in both HAE and PRACAs Sithembiso Maseko said: “The competition aims at showcasing what models can bring to the modelling industry and to give them an extra boost of confidence. “Some of the models are not yet professional, so we, as HAE, are trying to get them exposure and give them an extra boost of confidence through this event.” Dube said he was looking forward to a successful launch of his album and to connect with fans and those who will be participating in the PRACA awards.
