The Glen View area 8 residents were yesterday ecstatic after the Presidential Borehole Scheme moved into the area to install solar powered boreholes into 1000 houses. The project which is part of Government’s plan to end water woes in urban surbubs started  in Chitungwiza early this year and is set to install 50 solar powered boreholes that will service at least 1000 houses in the area. The scheme which was launched by President Mnangagwa last month is expected to  provide clean water to all citizens. The company that is in partnership with the Presidential Borehole Scheme, Prevail International general manager Tendayi Sithole said the project is an ongoing process and are also planning to service the rural population at the earliest time. “The success of this project will enable us to see how many boreholes we will drill as this project will cover the whole country,” Sithole said. Zanu PF shadow MP for Glenview North Constituency Martin Mambo thanked the President Mnangagwa saying he had delivered what he promised after the recent Cholera outbreak. “The president once visited us during a cholera outbreak and he promised to deal with our water woes and now he is walking the talk. We were used to go for more than a week without water but with this project we say goodbye to our water challenges,”Mambo said. The scheme’s chief executive officer, Mr Tempter Tungwarara, when he started the project he said he was targeting to drill 350 boreholes in Harare. Other constituencies to get boreholes in Harare are Highfield East in Ward 24, Highfield West in Ward 29, Kuwadzana 6, Kuwadzana 4 in the Paddocks area, Kambuzuma, Mufakose , Harare Central (Queensdale), Harare East (Chikurubi Maximum Prison and Support Unit), among others.
