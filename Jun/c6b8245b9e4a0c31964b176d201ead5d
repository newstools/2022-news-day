FOUNDED by visionary Natasha Vimbai Zveurombo in 2021, Miss Facial Beauty is a local pageant which prioritises and celebrates the culture, independence as well as heritage of the girl child. In a recent interview with NewsDay Life & Style, director for the pageant Isaac Madzivanyika said they were doing free registration for aspiring models from the ages 18-28 who would like to contest for Miss Facial Beauty 2023. He said they were conducting free registration for models to challenge them to push the boundaries of their limitations and create space in which young women can access training and learn life skills to enhance their physical beauty while also nurturing their internal persona. “We need to give everyone an opportunity to showcase themselves no matter skin colour, body shape and other physical attributes. We should give them the platform for free because not everyone can afford to pay for registration and audition yet many of them out there are talented but unprivileged,” he said. Madzivanyika added that in uplifting the girl child, their goal as a pageant was to have a listening ear as well as help girls set attainable goals and reinforce the importance of positive life skills such as hard work, persistence, positive attitude and responsibility for a better future. He added: “Several people believe that beauty pageants promote empowerment and lucrative opportunities but these opportunities do not only knock on their doors alone, but rather it also boosts the confidence of other beauticians and designers who always wanted to build a career in this field.” Madzivanyika said from last year’s pageant, they realised that contestants often became stronger and learnt more in defeat than in victory. In addition, they also learn the value of positive attitude, getting along with others and accepting the results graciously, and so the pageant strives to uplift the girl child.
