FORMER Highlanders rightback McClive Phiri has set his sights on rejoining Highlanders after he was released by South African second tier league side, Venda Football Club. Phiri is one of the 15 players offloaded by Venda, while Warriors defender Gerald Takwara survived. The defender, who left Highlanders in 2020 to join Bidvest Wits in the South African top league, is said to be in the country and the Bulawayo giants’ spokesperson Nozibelo Maphosa confirmed that Phiri was already training with the club. “All I can confirm right now is that he is training with the team,” Maphosa said. Phiri had a roller-coaster affair in his career. As soon as he joined Bidvest Wits, the club sold its franchise to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and the former fringe Warriors defender was released. He tried his luck at Sekhukhune United before their promotion to the South African top league but when the team was elevated, Phiri was dropped. Phiri moved to Venda FC last year, but his form hit rock bottom and has been released by the lowly club. With defender Andrew Tandi injured and likely to be on the sidelines for some time, Phiri might come in handy for Highlanders new coach Baltemar Brito. Tandi, a centreback partnering Peter Muduhwa, suffered a career-threatening injury when he was hacked down by Dynamos’ Bill Antonio in their abandoned Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie at Barbourfields Stadium last month. Andrew Mbeba, who had been entrusted with the rightback, played a central role in the 1-0 win over Harare City at BF with utility player Rahman Kutsanzira thrust to the rightback by coach Joel Luphahla. Chrispen Ncube, also a rightback, could be on his way out during the transfer window, as he has failed to command a first team jersey in recent months with another utility player Pritchard Mpelele likely to have bounced back from injury.
