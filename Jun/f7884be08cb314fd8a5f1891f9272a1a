FIREBRAND Yadah coach Genesis Mangombe is confident of upsetting Bulawayo Chiefs when they face off in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. Mangombe admits that the Ninjas are one of the most organized teams in the league but insisted that his side have what it takes to take all three points. Basking in the glow of a spirited display which earned his side a crucial point in a drawn game against log leaders Chicken Inn, Mangombe insisted he was ready for the Bulawayo side. He said they would stick to their tried and tested philosophy. “We are going to play Bulawayo Chiefs, they are a good side, a well- organized team and maybe a bit stable in terms of finance.  But this is a game of football, we are going to make sure we play according to our philosophy and at all costs we need to surprise them. We badly need to win this game so that we are in a better position as far as relegation battle is concerned. We just want to avoid relegation and to achieve that we must give confidence to the youngsters in the team,” Mangombe said yesterday. The Anointing Boys as Yadah are affectionately known are anticipating to finish off the first half of the season ahead of the two-week mid-season break. Mangombe added that they had respect for Bulawayo Chiefs they did not fear them. He said they would employ the system that saw them take a valuable point against Chicken Inn in the previous match. “We are not intimidated by any opponent if you look at the way we played against Chicken Inn. I feel we should have won that match but it was unfortunate that we let down by lack of maturity and that concentration level so we are going to address that,” he said. Currently Yadah are ranked 14th on the league table with 14 points while Bulawayo Chiefs are in ninth position with 22 points Bulawayo Chiefs are basking in glory following their 2-0 win over Harare football giants Caps United.
