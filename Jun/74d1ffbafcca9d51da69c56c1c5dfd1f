Benjani Mwaruwari says there will be a major culling at Ngezi Platinum to give more youngsters a chance to showcase their skills in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. The ambitious Mhondoro-based side has a developmental side that is thriving in the Northern Region Soccer League and Mwaruwari believes it is the right time to pluck more rookies and give them an opportunity to shine in the topflight league. Mwaruwari is determined to follow the route which was taken by Norman Mapeza at FC Platinum when the latter’s team let go of senior players at the beginning of the season. For Mapeza, the rookies have settled in the team and are already yielding results as they are now in contention to defend the title. According to the former Warriors captain, the local game is stagnant at this point because of lack of vibrant junior development structures, a thing he believes can only be rectified by coaches to lift the standard of the game. “We need to give the youngsters a chance. Like I said at first that I will take a chance with them and that’s my responsibility. “If they show that they can, indeed play, I won’t hesitate but at the same time, I take the risk of losing games if they are not good enough to win games. “But as soon as they get used to competition, I think they will give us good results,” he said. The former Manchester City star was at pains explaining how difficult it has been for him to coach some of the players. Things have gone bad since long back. I don’t come to this level to teach basic things. At this level we expect to teach tactics and tactical awareness. “But now the situation here is we are starting from zero to teach basics, but I want to take the opportunity to encourage the nation and coaches to give these youngsters the direction and a chance to be exposed to topflight
football.”
