FOR those who are usually concerned about what gets into their stomach, it should be customary to know the ingredients used in preparing their meals. Others can even go a step further wanting to know the recipe too. And the hungry sungura maestro Alick Macheso’s fans, who for almost four years have been salivating for a new musical meal in the form of a new album, are probably eager to know what ingredients were used to prepare Macheso’s upcoming offering. Macheso has been in the kitchen, Alema Studios, in the dormitory town of Chitungwiza for some time and tonight dinner in the form of Tinosvitswa Nashe (God will get us there) will be served at Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza. Assisting the sous chef Macheso was veteran “midas touch chefs”, producer Bothwell Nyamhondera and engineer Arron Tom. No doubt, many hungry sungura fans are eager to know what makes up the dish they will be served tonight. Hold your breath, the recipe has only six ingredients: Makazvinzwepi, Kutadzirana, Nzendo Dzirefu, Impfa Nimunandi, Ndimi Vanhu Vacho and Munhu Mumwe. Those are the songs that make up Macheso’s 12th album. Your meal is ready and may all the Sungura fans enjoy tonight. Macheso’s colleagues in showbiz, Freeman, Selmor Mtukudzi, Leonard Zhakata, Baba Harare, Andy Muridzo and Nicholas Zakaria have already confirmed that they will be coming for dinner tonight. The launch will be a triple celebration for the fans, the sungura doyen and his band as he celebrates his 54th birthday tonight, while the band is turning 24. Baba Sharo, as he is fondly known by his legion of fans, was born on June 10, 1968 at Bindura Hospital and he formed Orchestra Mberikwazvo in 1998. Happy birthday Baba Sharo and band. We wish you many more years to come.
