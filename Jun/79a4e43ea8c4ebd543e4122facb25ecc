CONTEMPORARY hitmaker Jah Prayzah will again ignite the weekend’s party mood today by sharing the stage with Nigerian singer and superstar Burna Boy as a supporting artiste. Born Mukudzei Mukombe, Jah Prazah recently shared the stage with South African rapper Casper Nyovest at the King’s Concert event held at Woods & Pub Grill Long Chain Plaza. Jah Prayzah’s involvement with another foreign act could be proof that promoters are appreciating that he is, indeed, a crowd puller. Preparations are underway for one of the Nigerian superstar’s many global concert tours dubbed “Space Drift”. Burna Boy is expected to come and perform along with his full band. Organisers of the concert, Hidden Culture confirmed on their website that it is going to be strictly a no under 18 gig. They also made it clear that vendors will not be allowed to sell alcohol at the event. Burna Boy, real name Damini Ogulu, is known for some of his Afro-fusion hits such as On the Low, Bank on it, Anybody, Odogwu, Gibana and Kilometre, among others. It seems Jah Prayzah is attracting international artistes’ attention on a daily basis as they are continuing to share the stage with him. He once shared the stage with Joe Boy where he stole the title man of the moment and recently he announced that he is working on a new collaboration with Mzansi Queen Makhadzi with whom he collaborated on Kokovha. As the COVID-19 pandemic threat slowly subsidises, it is gratifying that the Zimbabwean showbiz is awakening to the new era.
