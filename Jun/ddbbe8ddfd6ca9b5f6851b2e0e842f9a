JERUSAREMA/MBENDE outfit, Goromonzi Arts ensemble, on Saturday emerged winners in the Mashonaland East provincial Chibuku Neshamwari traditional dance competition held at Murewa Centre. The group shrugged off stiff competition from seven other groups and walked away US$2 500 richer. Mudzi-based Kwinimbira dance outfit Nzwananai Arts Group came second, while another Goromonzi mbende outfit, Makarekare came third and walked away with US$1 500 and US$1 000, respectively. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe provincial manager Chido Erengwi said the competition went on well, adding that they were now focusing on the national finals. “As a province we are proud that we are going to be represented by a very energetic Jerusarema/mbende dance which is our trademark. “We wish the group the best at the national finals. We are happy that the competition went on well and those who won deserved it,” she said. Jerusarema/mbende is a trademark dance in the province and is popular in Murewa and Uzumba. In 2013, Ngoma Dzepasi, a Jerusarema/ mbende outfit won the national finals held in Harare.
